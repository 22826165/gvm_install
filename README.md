# gvm_install
A script to install GVM / OpenVAS 11 on Ubuntu 20.04

Usage (note the text editor - read the script!):

nano install_gvm.sh
chmod +x install_gvm.sh
sudo ./install_gvm.sh 
```

Based on [koromicha's excellent guide](https://kifarunix.com/install-and-setup-gvm-11-on-ubuntu-20-04/). Thanks to the commenters there as well:


Takes a while to do everything (a couple of hours on my last test).

When creating a task be sure to select the "Created OpenVAS Scanner" from the drop-down.
